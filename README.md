# FatmapTask

Testing project for Fatmap. This a simple React Native App displaying a list of places and when any of them is selected, it renders a map+route using a Swift native renderer, passing all communication through the React Native bridge.

This is more a POC than a final work.

Install and run:

1- Download/clone the project.

2- Run `$ npm install` on project's root directory `FatmapTask`.

3- Install iOS pods:
    a) Run `$ cd ios` (from project's root directory).
    b) Run `$ pod install`.
    
4- Run `$ cd ..` (go back to root).

5- Run `$ react-native run-ios` to execute the App in the iOS simulator.
